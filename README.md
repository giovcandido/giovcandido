Hope you're all sleeping well and not having to drink more coffee than you should!

I'm a ~~rockstar~~ __software developer__ and ~~astronaut~~ __Computer Science student__.

## Background

In 2014, I had my first coding experience with Codecademy. I was so amazed by the idea of creating computer programs that could do what I wanted them to do that I decided that was the thing I'd be happy working with.

As I wanted to get deeper and more experienced, I've been learning computer science professionally since I was in high school. I intend to be a __Software Engineer__ after I graduate and am open to discuss __exciting job offers__.
